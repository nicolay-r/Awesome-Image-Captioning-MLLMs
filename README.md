# Awesome-Image-Captioning-MLLMs
> **NOTE:** A curated list of awesome Image captioning strudies, aimed at annotating and reporting *CT / MRI scans*

## Focus of the Studies and Limitation 🎯

In the era since the announcement of the self-attention mechanism, the [Transformers architecture]() has become a game-chaning architecture in the field of machine-translation.
These findings and advances were quicly mitigated onto other fields in natural language processing (NLP) is when we end up with *Language Models* [[encoder-based]]() and [[generative]]() we aware of so far.
This repository represent a collection of the systems and findids that may help you to advance yourself in development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), that support the following modalities:
1. 🖼️ **Image** (Photo, Scans, even Footages / Video frames gathered into sigle image)
2. 📝 **Text** (Caption / Report / Question)
